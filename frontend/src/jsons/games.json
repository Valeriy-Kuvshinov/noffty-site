        "description": "There are rumors of an artifact which has powers so great its incomprehensible. Now its time for you and Matchstick to go on a journey for it. This wont be easy though since there's danger around every corner, Good luck. This game is a proper remake of 'Sley Tha Spooir' which got the 21st place in the GMTK Game Jam 2019. Betorched is a series of turn based combat encounters with items and character progression in between them. Its a roguelite so there is permadeath and most elements of each playthrough are randomized. It might look simple but offers a lot of gameplay depth, Lore, Worldbuilding and an overall (I hope) enjoyable experience. This is my latest and greatest game up to date. I would love to hear your thoughts on it, I have some Betorched updates planned but mostly it is a finished product. Thanks for checking it out, hope you enjoy!",

The corruptions are random so each run is going to be unique. Also there are some combos, movement techniques and secrets which arent obvious, try figuring them out! I was really tight on time but I think it turned out pretty nice, hope you enjoy it.",
